"The life and travels of Fransisco de Miranda"|Puebla de Zaragoza|Mexico|||2023|11-3-2023|[]|[]|[]|"The following story is an account of the life of Fransisco de Miranda, his adventures, impact on history and the people he met. Fransisco de Miranda was a Venezuelan revolutionary who fought in the American war of independence, the French revolution and the Venezuelan wars of independence. I decided to make this info page after traveling through South America and learning more about their revolutionary history and discovering Fransisco de Miranda. There's a lot of information about the famous characters of the revolutions like Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín, the information about Miranda is far less accesable but he lived an extremely interesting life, therefore I decided to write this account of his life. Miranda fought tirelessly for the independence of the American colonies but was born too early, he's known in history as 'The Precursor' of Latin American independence. The whole story is written by me, the main information is sourced from the book 'Life of Miranda' by William Spence Robertson (1929) which is public domain. All accompanying maps are made by me as well with Python and GeoPandas, I've tried to recreate the historical borders as accurately as possible(but they are an aproximation). Press the right button on the portret and enjoy this amazing story about Fransisco de Miranda!"

However, despite his talent and wealth, Francisco was subject to predjudice within the aristocracy of the Spanish Empire because his father was an immigrant from the Empire's territory in the Canary Islands, whereas those in power immigrated from Spain. This discrimination would later lead to conflict within the ruling circles, contributing to Marinada's decision to leave Venezuela as a young adult."
